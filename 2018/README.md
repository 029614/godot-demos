# 2018 Godot demos

All of these demos work in Godot 3.

## Astar pathfinding - 03/30/2018

I wrote this project as an [ official demo ](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/pull/236) to help people get started with the engine. Godot's AStar pathfinding class is both flexible and powerful, but it can be a little daunting at first. You'll find a commented script in the project, and a character that smoothly follows paths using the follow steering behavior.

You'll also find an updated [ Navigation2D demo ](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/master/2d/navigation) in the official sources to go along with it.
